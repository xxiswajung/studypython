Studying algorithm and data structure by python

- Upload some specific algorithm problem solving to my [velog](https://velog.io/@ghkwjd06) written by Korean. 
- I do NOT share original algorithm problems of each solving because they are belong to online paid courses. Sorry for that!
- I'm looking for good website(or blog) that I can share algorithm with everyone who are studying coding. If you know some great blog or website that is able to be written by English and well known, please let me know by this repository Issues.
